A fun and simple Excercise in JS while between bigger React projects.

In this project, I focused on:

* Getting user value from input and saving it.
* Generate a random number 1 to 100 and saving it.
* Create a function to move the logic for if the guess is too high, too low, or correct and display the correct dialog.
* Display the guess history in logical order.
